      solution:
        "I designed a system where a local IoT gateway device (like a Raspberry Pi or an industrial controller) was connected directly to the tank sensors. This gateway was responsible for reading the raw sensor data, processing it, and then publishing it to a secure API endpoint on the Laravel server. The web frontend then used Ajax polling at a set interval to fetch the latest data from the server and update the dashboard, providing a near real-time view without overloading the network or the sensors.",
