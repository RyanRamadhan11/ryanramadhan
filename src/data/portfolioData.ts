      "A real-time production line monitoring dashboard for Astra Honda Motor, integrating live data and CCTV feeds to enhance operational oversight.",
    description:
      "Developed a comprehensive web-based dashboard to monitor production line activities at Astra Honda Motor in real-time. The system aggregates data from multiple database sources, displays key performance indicators (KPIs), and integrates seamlessly with the existing CCTV network, providing supervisors with a unified view of the factory floor. The frontend utilizes Ajax and jQuery for dynamic updates without page reloads, ensuring a smooth user experience.",

      "Data aggregation from multiple legacy and modern database systems.",
      "Dynamic UI updates using Ajax for a non-disruptive monitoring experience.",
    ],
    challenges: {
      problem:
        "The primary challenge was integrating and synchronizing data from two different database systems (a legacy SQL Server and a modern MySQL) without causing performance bottlenecks. Additionally, displaying low-latency CCTV streams in a web browser efficiently was a major hurdle.",
      solution:
        "I implemented Laravel's Multiple Database Connections feature to manage data from both sources seamlessly. For the real-time aspect, Firebase Realtime Database was used as a message broker to push live data updates to the frontend. For CCTV, we utilized a streaming protocol (like RTSP to HLS) to embed the video feeds with minimal latency.",

    description:
      "This project serves as the central nervous system for the EQC Machining process. It's a web-based application built on Laravel that empowers administrators to manage all master data (parts, models, quality standards). The system provides full traceability of parts via RFID scanning, offers detailed historical data checking, and generates comprehensive production reports. Crucially, it acts as the single source of truth, providing data consumed by other critical factory applications, including the real-time Line Monitoring dashboard and a desktop analysis tool.",

        "Establishing a stable and reliable low-level socket connection to the Fanuc machine controller, which uses a proprietary communication protocol, was a significant challenge. The application needed to handle various network conditions and machine states without crashing or losing data.",
      solution:
        "I utilized the .NET System.Net.Sockets library to build a custom communication layer that implements the Fanuc FOCAS protocol. The solution includes robust error handling and asynchronous operations to keep the UI responsive, even during long data transfers or network interruptions, ensuring stable communication.",

    description:
      "This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing high-value cutting tools in a precision manufacturing environment. It tracks the entire lifecycle of each tool, from registration to usage transactions and eventual disposal. A key feature is the module for recording and tracking tool offset measurements (Z and X values), which are critical for CNC machine setup and accuracy.

    challenges: {
      problem:
        "The most critical challenge was ensuring the absolute accuracy and integrity of the Z and X offset data. A small error in these values could lead to costly material waste or damage to the CNC machine. The system needed a foolproof way to log and verify these measurements.",
      solution:
        "I designed a two-step verification process for data entry. After an operator inputs the offset values, a supervisor must review and approve the entry before the tool is marked as 'ready for use' in the system. All changes are logged in an immutable audit trail using Firebase, ensuring that there is a permanent record of every measurement and approval, which is crucial for quality control.",

      solution:
        "I developed a responsive, mobile-first web interface for the scanning feature using a robust JavaScript library for camera access and QR code decoding. To ensure speed, the validation logic was offloaded to a dedicated, optimized API endpoint in Laravel. This provided instant feedback to the operator while the full transaction was processed asynchronously in the background.",
